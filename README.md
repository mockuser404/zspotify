Requirements:

Binaries

- Python 3.9 or greater
- ffmpeg*
- Git**

Python packages:

- pip install -r requirements.txt

```

\*ffmpeg can be installed via apt for Debian-based distros or by downloading the binaries from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org) and placing them in your %PATH% in Windows. Mac users can install it with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) by running `brew install ffmpeg`.

\*\*Git can be installed via apt for Debian-based distros or by downloading the binaries from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) for Windows.

### Command line usage:

```
Basic usage:
  python zspotify                                      Loads search prompt to find then download a specific track, album or playlist
  python zspotify <track/album/playlist/episode url>   Downloads the track, album, playlist or podcast episode specified as a command line argument
  python zspotify <artist url>                         Downloads all albums by specified artist

Extra command line options:
  -p, --playlist       Downloads a saved playlist from your account
  -ls, --liked-songs   Downloads all the liked songs from your account

Options that can be configured in zs_config.json:
  ROOT_PATH           Change this path if you don't like the default directory where ZSpotify saves the music
  ROOT_PODCAST_PATH   Change this path if you don't like the default directory where ZSpotify saves the podcasts

  SKIP_EXISTING_FILES Set this to false if you want ZSpotify to overwrite files with the same name rather than skipping the song

  MUSIC_FORMAT        Can be "mp3" or "ogg", mp3 is required for track metadata however ogg is slightly higher quality as it is not transcoded.

  FORCE_PREMIUM       Set this to true if ZSpotify isn't automatically detecting that you are using a premium account

  ANTI_BAN_WAIT_TIME  Change this setting if the time waited between bulk downloads is too high or low
  OVERRIDE_AUTO_WAIT  Change this to true if you want to completely disable the wait between songs for faster downloads with the risk of instability
```

### Docker Usage

```
Pull the official docker image (automatically updates):
  docker pull cooper7692/zspotify-docker
Or build the docker image yourself from the Dockerfile:
  docker build -t zspotify .
Create and run a container from the image:
  docker run --rm -v "$PWD/ZSpotify Music:/ZSpotify Music" -v "$PWD/ZSpotify Podcasts:/ZSpotify Podcasts" -it zspotify
```
